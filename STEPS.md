# Development stage

   1. Initialize the project: I will set up a new React application using Vite.

   2. Structure the application: I will create the necessary folders for components, services, and hooks as specified.

   3. Component Development: I will create the React components for each feature, including adding books, displaying book details, and the personal library dashboard.

   4. Service Integration: I will write the services to handle interactions with the Open Library API and Firebase for data storage and audio uploads.

   5. Styling: I will add CSS to create a colorful, child-friendly, and responsive user interface.

   6. Documentation: I will create a README.md file with instructions on how to set up and run the project.


## The Choice

**TypeScript** has been chosen over **Javascript** to ensure the application is robust and easier to maintain. TypeScript's static typing helps catch errors early in development, improves code quality, and provides better autocompletion, which is beneficial for a project of this scope.
It is also a modern standard for professional React development.
